# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

Live Demo: https://singaporeresalepricepredictor.streamlit.app/

## Project Overview

The Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application. This predictive model estimates the resale prices of flats in Singapore based on historical resale flat transactions data. The project is motivated by the competitive nature of the resale flat market in Singapore and the challenges associated with accurately estimating resale values.

## Skills Developed

The project involves the following key skills:

- **Data Wrangling:** Collecting and preprocessing resale flat transactions data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date.

- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Analyzing and exploring the dataset to gain insights into the patterns and trends of resale flat prices.

- **Model Building:** Selecting and training an appropriate machine learning model for regression using features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.

- **Model Deployment:** Developing a user-friendly web application using Streamlit and deploying it on the Render platform to make resale price predictions accessible over the internet.

## Domain

Real Estate

## Problem Statement

The objective is to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of flats in Singapore, considering factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration.

## Motivation

The resale flat market in Singapore is competitive, and accurate estimation of resale values is challenging. A machine learning model can provide users with estimated resale prices based on historical data and relevant features.

## Scope

The project scope includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training, model evaluation, web application development, deployment, testing, and validation.

## Deliverables

1. A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
2. A user-friendly web application (built with Streamlit/Flask) deployed on the Render platform or any cloud platform.
3. Documentation and instructions for using the application.
4. A project report summarizing the data analysis, model development, and deployment process.
